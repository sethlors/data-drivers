## Cloning this Repository Locally

To work with this repository on your local machine, you need to clone it from the remote source.

1. **Ensure you have Git installed**  
   If Git is not installed on your system, download and install it for your OS from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Set up SSH keys (optional but recommended)**  
   To securely communicate with GitHub (or your preferred Git hosting platform), it's recommended to set up SSH keys. Follow these steps:

    - [Generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) if you donâ€™t already have one:
      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_github_email@example.com"
      ```
    - Add the SSH key to your GitHub account by following the steps in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

   **Note:** If you prefer HTTPS instead of SSH, you can skip this step.

3. **Clone the repository**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt in the directory of your choosing and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sethlors/data-drivers
   ```

4. **Verify and navigate into the project directory**  
   After cloning successfully, move into the project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd data-drivers
   ```

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Examples of branch names:
    - `feature/add-api-methods`
    - `bugfix/fix-auth-issue`
