# Formula 1 Data Repository

## Overview
This repository contains **Formula 1 data** used for analysis, modeling, and visualizations. The dataset includes historical Formula 1 information, sourced from **OpenF1** and **Ergast**, free and open-source APIs.

## Data Source
We obtain our F1 data from both **[OpenF1](https://openf1.org/)** and **[Ergast](https://ergast.com/downloads/f1db_csv.zip)**, both offer real-time and historical insights, including:
- **Lap timings**
- **Car telemetry (speed, throttle, brake, etc.)**
- **Pit stop data**
- **Radio communications**
- **Weather conditions**
- And more.
